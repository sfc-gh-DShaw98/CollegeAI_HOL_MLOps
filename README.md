## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Lab Overview

In this hands-on lab, you‚Äôll step into the shoes of an **MLOps engineer** tasked with **operationalizing a predictive model trained in Amazon SageMaker‚Äîbut all the customer data lives in Snowflake**. Instead of rewriting model logic or deploying a real-time endpoint, you‚Äôll register the model in Snowflake‚Äôs Model Registry and run batch inference at scale using warehouse compute.

### üìã What You‚Äôll Do:
- **Phase‚ÄØ1: [Model Development & SageMaker Integration](lab_instructions/phase1_setup.md)**
  - **Train** and evaluate an XGBoost model in **SageMaker**
  - **Log** the model into [**Snowflake Model Registry**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/overview) 
  - **Perform batch-scoring** on historical mortgage data stored **in Snowflake** (Weeks 1‚Äì5)

- **Phase‚ÄØ2: [Model Monitoring with Snowflake ML Observability](lab_instructions/phase2_observability.md)**
  - **Configure** [**Snowflake ML Observability**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/model-observability) to baseline, monitor performance, and detect drift
  - **Configure** [**Snowflake Alerts**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-alerts) to send email notification for performance degradation
  - **Generate custom** performance reports and visualizations

- **Phase‚ÄØ3: [End-to-End Model Retraining in Snowflake ML](lab_instructions/phase3_retraining.md)**
  - **Preprocess** updated training data using [**Snowpark ML**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-ml/index) (e.g. OneHotEncoder)
  - **Register features and entities** in the [**Snowflake Feature Store**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/feature-store/overview)
  - **Train** a new binary classification **model natively in Snowflake**
  - **Log** the new model version to the [**Snowflake Model Registry**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/overview)
  - **Use** [**Snowflake ML Explainability**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/model-explainability) to interpret the model
  - **Monitor drift** with [**Snowflake ML Observability**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/model-observability) between V1 and V2
  - **Promote** V2 to production using [**model version aliases**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/overview#model-version-aliases)
  - **Run version-agnostic batch scoring** or [inference in Snowflake warehouses](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/warehouse) using the [**PRODUCTION alias**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/model-registry/overview#model-version-aliases)

## üß≠ Customer Discovery Questions

Provide **5 to 6 open-ended questions** for customer conversations related to this HOL.

- "Do you train models in SageMaker or another platform while your inference data lives in Snowflake?"
- "How are you managing model lifecycle and versioning across platforms today?"
- "Is batch scoring a requirement for your business processes (e.g., sub-hourly/hourly/nightly/weekly runs)?"
- "How do you evaluate or monitor model performance in production?"
- "Would centralizing models and data improve collaboration between data teams?"
- "How long does it take to get a typical new model into production?"
- "How do you manage model promotion that is creating a new model version to replace an older one in a production pipeline?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

These are the most common blockers and questions SEs encounter when completing the College of AI: MLOps with SageMaker & Snowflake Model Registry HOL.

**1. üîê Authentication & Snowpark Connection Errors**
  - **Error:** `Failed to connect` to DB or `Authentication attempt rejected by the current authentication policy`
  - **Cause:** Invalid JWT token, IP not allowed, or misconfigured `connections.toml`
  - **Tips:**
    - Use **`mlops_user`** inside SageMaker (not your SE Snowflake user).
    - Ensure your IP is correctly added to your network policy allowlist: run `!curl ifconfig.me` and check Snowflake's network policy.
    - Confirm your `connections.toml` file has the correct path, and the key includes the full `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY / END PRIVATE KEY` block.
    - If using key-pair auth, **delete your existing key files** and regenerate both keys using:
      ```bash
      openssl genrsa -out rsa_private_key.pem 2048
      openssl rsa -in rsa_private_key.pem -pubout -out rsa_public_key.pem
      ```
    - Be sure your public key includes the full:
      ```bash
      ALTER USER mlops_user SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      ...
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----';
      ```
    - **Download the private key file** and upload it directly into your SageMaker instance to avoid formatting issues. Don‚Äôt try to copy/paste from a preview or browser view.

**2. ‚òÅÔ∏è SageMaker Access & Sandbox Issues**
  - **Error:** `Permission denied` when loading data from S3
  - **Cause:** Running in the wrong AWS account (e.g., onboarding or capstone sandbox)
  - **Fix:** Use the **AWS SE Sandbox** (not onboarding or se-capstone). If needed, submit a [**LIFT**](https://lift.snowflake.com/lift?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=de9fc362db7dd4102f1c9eb6db9619ed) ticket to request access.

**3. üßë‚Äçüîß Incorrect User Role Usage**
  - **Issue:** Code fails due to role/permission issues
  - **Tip:** Follow the guide for when to use:
    - `mlops_user` (SageMaker programmatic access)
    - Your SE Snowflake account (Snowsight setup and model monitoring)

**4. ‚öôÔ∏è Private Key or PAT Setup Fails**
  - **Error:** `"New public key rejected by current policy"` or `"Invalid public key"`
  - **Cause:** Account's authentication policy restricts key-based access
  - **Fix:**
    - **Regenerate the key pair** using the openssl commands above (#1 FAQ Tip).
    - Ensure your public key is correctly updated in your Snowflake user profile
    - Upload the private key file into SageMaker and update your `connections.toml`
    - Double-check that the private key **starts and ends with the required headers**, and avoid using rich-text editors that could introduce formatting problems

**5. üîß SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT Underscore-to-Hyphen Requirement**
  - **Issue:** `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` when connecting to Snowflake from SageMaker
  - **Cause:** the value for `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` contains an underscore, which is not allowed in the host URL used for connection
  - **Fix:**
    - Replace underscores (`_`) with hyphens (`-`) in your `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` value.
    - Example:
    - ‚ùå `SFSEEUROPE-US_DEMO603`
    - ‚úÖ `SFSEEUROPE-US-DEMO603`
    - This resolves SSL errors caused by malformed domain names in HTTPS-based Snowflake connections.

**6. üõ† Placeholder (XXX) Values Not Replaced**
  - **Issue:** Cells fail to execute or generate unexpected results
  - **Fix:** Use the provided **XXX Replacement Guide** to complete all fields such as:
    - `X_train`, `model_name`, `sample_input_data`, `PREDICTED_SCORE`, etc.
    - **Tip:** Use `search (XXX)` in your notebook to find all incomplete replacements.

**7. üìâ Model Registration or Explainability Errors**
  - **Error:** `"Explainability for this model is not supported"` or ValueError on registration
  - **Cause:** Incorrect input format or explainability limitations in current model setup
  - **Workaround:** Disable explainability temporarily and retry model registration.

**8. üß™ DORA Completion Not Showing**
  - **Issue:** DORA steps (e.g., `SEAI50`, SEA51`, `SEAI52`, `SEAI53`, `SEAI54`) don‚Äôt appear as completed in the Tableau dashboard, even after finishing the lab
  - **Cause:** You may have skipped the grading and greeting function cells (often near the end of each notebook phase). Your Snowflake account may be missing a greeting assignment in the SE_GREETER function, which is required for linking your submissions to the dashboard.
  - **Fix:** ‚úÖ **Ensure you check the completion box** at the end of each phase:
    - Look for a grading section in the notebook (e.g., RegisterRetrainedModel) that asks you to check a box or run a grading function **‚Äî this is required to trigger DORA tracking**
    - If you did not check the box or skipped that cell, **go back and complete it**
    - **üîÅ Still not showing up?**
      - Double-check that your greeting function ran correctly, with mixed case for your first and last name:
      
      ```sql
      SELECT util_db.public.se_greeting('your.email@snowflake.com', 'First', '', 'Last');
      ```
      - Re-run the grading function for any missing step:
      ```sql
      SELECT util_db.public.se_grader('SEAI52', TRUE, 1, 1, 'Phase 1 complete');
      ```
      - Validate that your `util_db` has both the SE_GREETER and SE_GRADER external functions
      - üìù Note: Even if your completion doesn't appear in Tableau, all submissions are still logged in Snowhouse and can be validated later if needed.

**9. üß™ SageMaker JupyterLab Space Setup & Image Compatibility**
  - **Issue:** Users encounter unexpected errors (e.g., missing libraries, broken imports) when running notebooks
  - **Cause:** Selecting the **wrong JupyterLab image** (e.g., defaulting to 3.0.0 or another incompatible version). Confusion between **creating a new Domain** vs. **a JupyterLab space**. You're creating a **JupyterLab space**, not a new SageMaker Domain. The Domain was pre-created by SE-Sandbox admins. Only **JupyterLab spaces** incur cost while running ‚Äî you‚Äôre safe to stop/restart without deleting anything.
  - **Required image:** `SageMaker Distribution 2.4.2`‚ùóOther versions (e.g., `3.0.0`) will cause missing module errors.
  - **Fix:**
    - From **SageMaker Studio**, click **+ Create JupyterLab space**
      - Name it like `college-of-ai-yourname`
      - Select **Private space** (not a new Domain)
    - After creation, **switch image** to `SageMaker Distribution 2.4.2`
      - Errors like ModuleNotFoundError or broken ML commands will occur if using the wrong image
      - If resuming later, restart your space and **reconfirm image = 2.4.2**
    - ‚úÖ Files persist between sessions ‚Äî only running spaces incur cost

**10. üìé Can‚Äôt Copy from Docs (Security Restriction)**
  - **Issue:** Unable to copy/paste from Google Docs
  - **Fix:** Use the official GitHub repository or PDFs distributed by the enablement team.
